Step 1 | Score: 0.303
TEXT: To solve the problem, we need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing ropes \(HC\) and \(HD\) with a single rope \(HP\), where \(P\) is a point on the straight line between \(C\) and \(D\).
First, let's analyze the given distances:
- \(C\) is directly south of \(O\).
- \(D\) is directly east of \(O\).
- The distance between \(C\) and \(D\) is 140 meters.

Step 2 | Score: 0.424
TEXT: Since \(C\) and \(D\) are directly south and east of \(O\) respectively, the coordinates of the points can be set as follows:
- \(O = (0, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -h)\) (where \(h\) is the height of the balloon above \(O\))
- \(D = (d, 0)\) (where \(d\) is the distance from \(O\) to \(D\))
Given:
- \(HC = 150\) meters
- \(HD = 130\) meters

Step 3 | Score: 0.305
TEXT: We need to find the coordinates of \(H\) and \(P\) such that the total length of rope \(HP\) is maximized.
### Step 1: Determine the coordinates of \(H\)
Since \(H\) is directly above \(O\), its coordinates are \((0, h)\).

Step 4 | Score: 0.196
TEXT: ### Step 2: Use the distance formula to find \(h\)
Using the distance formula for \(HC\):
\[
HC = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (h + h)^2} = \sqrt{(2h)^2} = 2h
\]
Given \(HC = 150\):
\[
2h = 150 \implies h = 75 \text{ meters}
\]

Step 5 | Score: 0.083
TEXT: Using the distance formula for \(HD\):
\[
HD = \sqrt{(0 - d)^2 + (h - 0)^2} = \sqrt{d^2 + h^2}
\]
Given \(HD = 130\):
\[
\sqrt{d^2 + 75^2} = 130
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
d^2 + 5625 = 16900
\]
\[
d^2 = 11275
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{11275} = 106.18 \text{ meters}
\]
### Step 3: Determine the optimal point \(P\) on \(CD\)

Step 6 | Score: 0.220
TEXT: Let \(P\) be a point on \(CD\) such that \(P\) is between \(C\) and \(D\). The coordinates of \(P\) can be expressed as:
\[
P = (x, 0) \text{ where } 0 \leq x \leq d
\]
### Step 4: Minimize the total length of rope \(HP\)

Step 7 | Score: 0.309
TEXT: The length of \(HP\) is given by:
\[
HP = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 75)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 5625}
\]
To minimize \(HP\), we need to find the point \(P\) such that the total length of \(HP\) is minimized. This occurs when \(P\) is the point on \(CD\) such that \(P\) is the projection of \(H\) onto \(CD\).

Step 8 | Score: 0.184
TEXT: ### Step 5: Calculate the maximum length of \(HP\)
The maximum length of \(HP\) occurs when \(P\) is the midpoint of \(CD\). The coordinates of the midpoint \(P\) are:
\[
P = \left(\frac{d}{2}, 0\right)
\]

Step 9 | Score: 1.406
TEXT: Substitute \(d = 106.18\):
\[
P = \left(\frac{106.18}{2}, 0\right) = (53.09, 0)
\]
Now, calculate \(HP\):
\[
HP = \sqrt{(53.09 - 0)^2 + (0 - 75)^2} = \sqrt{53.09^2 + 75^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{2818.3681 + 5625} = \sqrt{8443.3681} \approx 91.88 \text{ meters}
\]
### Step 6: Calculate the savings

Five points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $O$ lie on a flat field.  $A$ is directly north of $O$, $B$ is directly west of $O$, $C$ is directly south of $O$, and $D$ is directly east of $O$.

--- 推論プロセスの全ステップ (Full Trajectory) ---
Step 1 | Score: 0.303
TEXT: To solve the problem, we need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing ropes \(HC\) and \(HD\) with a single rope \(HP\), where \(P\) is a point on the straight line between \(C\) and \(D\).
First, let's analyze the given distances:
- \(C\) is directly south of \(O\).
- \(D\) is directly east of \(O\).
- The distance between \(C\) and \(D\) is 140 meters.

Step 2 | Score: 0.424
TEXT: Since \(C\) and \(D\) are directly south and east of \(O\) respectively, the coordinates of the points can be set as follows:
- \(O = (0, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -h)\) (where \(h\) is the height of the balloon above \(O\))
- \(D = (d, 0)\) (where \(d\) is the distance from \(O\) to \(D\))
Given:
- \(HC = 150\) meters
- \(HD = 130\) meters

Step 3 | Score: 0.305
TEXT: We need to find the coordinates of \(H\) and \(P\) such that the total length of rope \(HP\) is maximized.
### Step 1: Determine the coordinates of \(H\)
Since \(H\) is directly above \(O\), its coordinates are \((0, h)\).

Step 4 | Score: 0.196
TEXT: ### Step 2: Use the distance formula to find \(h\)
Using the distance formula for \(HC\):
\[
HC = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (h + h)^2} = \sqrt{(2h)^2} = 2h
\]
Given \(HC = 150\):
\[
2h = 150 \implies h = 75 \text{ meters}
\]

Step 5 | Score: 0.083
TEXT: Using the distance formula for \(HD\):
\[
HD = \sqrt{(0 - d)^2 + (h - 0)^2} = \sqrt{d^2 + h^2}
\]
Given \(HD = 130\):
\[
\sqrt{d^2 + 75^2} = 130
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
d^2 + 5625 = 16900
\]
\[
d^2 = 11275
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{11275} = 106.18 \text{ meters}
\]
### Step 3: Determine the optimal point \(P\) on \(CD\)

Step 6 | Score: 0.220
TEXT: Let \(P\) be a point on \(CD\) such that \(P\) is between \(C\) and \(D\). The coordinates of \(P\) can be expressed as:
\[
P = (x, 0) \text{ where } 0 \leq x \leq d
\]
### Step 4: Minimize the total length of rope \(HP\)

Step 7 | Score: 0.309
TEXT: The length of \(HP\) is given by:
\[
HP = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 75)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 5625}
\]
To minimize \(HP\), we need to find the point \(P\) such that the total length of \(HP\) is minimized. This occurs when \(P\) is the point on \(CD\) such that \(P\) is the projection of \(H\) onto \(CD\).

Step 8 | Score: 0.184
TEXT: ### Step 5: Calculate the maximum length of \(HP\)
The maximum length of \(HP\) occurs when \(P\) is the midpoint of \(CD\). The coordinates of the midpoint \(P\) are:
\[
P = \left(\frac{d}{2}, 0\right)
\]

Step 9 | Score: 1.406
TEXT: Substitute \(d = 106.18\):
\[
P = \left(\frac{106.18}{2}, 0\right) = (53.09, 0)
\]
Now, calculate \(HP\):
\[
HP = \sqrt{(53.09 - 0)^2 + (0 - 75)^2} = \sqrt{53.09^2 + 75^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{2818.3681 + 5625} = \sqrt{8443.3681} \approx 91.88 \text{ meters}
\]

Step 7 | Score: 0.188
TEXT: Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, \(\angle T\) is the right angle, and the sine of a right angle is always 1. Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \sin{90^\circ} = 1
\]

Step 8 | Score: 0.152
TEXT: Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]

TEXT: To determine \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Step 2 | Score: 0.159
TEXT: Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle T = 90^\circ\).

TEXT: In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows:
- \(ST\) is the opposite side to \(\angle R\)
- \(RT\) is the hypotenuse
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Step 4 | Score: 0.133
TEXT: From the given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can set up the following relationship:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Step 5 | Score: 0.051
TEXT: Since \(RT\) is the hypotenuse and is given as 5, we can find the length of \(ST\):
\[
ST = 2
\]

Step 6 | Score: 0.101
TEXT: Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side \(RS\):
\[
RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2
\]
\[
RS^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
RS^2 + 4 = 25
\]
\[
RS^2 = 21

\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
